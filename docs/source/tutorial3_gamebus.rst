GameBus
=======

GameBus FHIR layer is a wrapper on top of GameBus platform, acting like a
translator. The layer itself does not have database, so not storing any data.
GameBus platform is where the data stored.

To use the FHIR layer, users need to create an account on GameBus platform
(for free) and then add some data to it for requesting later with FHIR REST API.
